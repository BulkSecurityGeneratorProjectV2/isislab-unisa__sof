# scud
SCUD is a Simulation exploration and optimization framework on the CloUD, designed in ISISLab, that allows to run and collect results for two kinds of scenario parameter space exploration (PSE) and simulation optimization (SO) considering the computational resources as available for a not fixed time and subjects to failure. SCUD was designed to manage three kinds of simulation engine: MASON, NetLogo and a generic simulator. SCUD provides some software facilities for MASON and NetLogo like the automatic simulation input setting and automatic output generating (that does not provide for the generic simulator, for obvious reasons). The generic simulator must be an executable compliant with the cluster machine used. SCUD provides a command line user application see the Wiki.
